# Externships App

By Jordan Epstein, with help and advice from Gabriel Buchdahl

## Our Mission

As Computer Science students, we've noticed a gap: there are many talented students on campus looking for computer science work, and very few jobs. Similarly, there is a disconnect between the theoretical Computer Science we learn in class and the practical skills expected of us in the workforce. This app is our attempt to solve this problem. By connecting bright students with start-ups who could use cheap labor, we kill two birds with one stone - and both students and employers emerge happy.

## Tech Stack

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- We used styled-components and Bootstrap for styling
